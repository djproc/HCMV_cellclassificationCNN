# HCMV Cell Classification (HCMVcc)
License: MIT (please use and share this code)

## Overview:
This code was  written for the explicit task of identifying HCMV (strain TB40/E) infected cells within a cell population at 96 hours post infection (h.p.i.).
Data input: 2,500 image slide-scan of a glass cover-slip 

## How can i use this code to classify things other than HCMV infected cells?:

## Learining resources: 
I can't reccomend the learning resources provided by Fast AI more. It is the best starting point for anyone new to deep learning for image classification or image segmentation. The codebase is consistently updated, as are the learning resources. 
However, the majority of this code utilizes python, so you will need to know the basics of that (and also the use of pandas dataframe).  

## Goals for the future development of this code:
1. Increasing efficiency, usability and extensibility of code
2. Connecting to GANs for dataset summarization
